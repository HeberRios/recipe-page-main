                <span> Beat the eggs:</span>
                In a bowl, beat the eggs with a pinch of salt and pepper until they
                are well mixed. You can add a tablespoon of water or milk for a fluffier
                texture.
            </li>
            <li>
                <span> Heat the pan:</span>
                Place a non-stick frying pan over medium heat and add butter or oil.
            </li>
            <li>
                <span> Cook the omelette:</span>
                Once the butter is melted and bubbling, pour in the eggs. Tilt the
                pan to ensure the eggs evenly coat the surface.
            </li>
            <li>
                <span> Add fillings (optional):</span>
                When the eggs begin to set at the edges but are still slightly runny
                in the middle, sprinkle your chosen fillings over one half of the
                omelette.
            </li>
            <li>
                <span> Fold and serve:</span>
                As the omelette continues to cook, carefully lift one edge and fold
                it over the fillings. Let it cook for another minute, then slide
                it onto a plate.
            </li>
            <li>
                <span> Enjoy:</span>
                Serve hot, with additional salt and pepper if needed.
            </li>
